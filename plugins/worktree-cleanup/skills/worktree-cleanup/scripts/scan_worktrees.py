"""Discover git worktrees across many repos and classify them by deletion risk.

Emits a human-readable table on stdout and a machine-readable plan as JSON
(``--json``) that ``remove_worktrees.py`` consumes.

The classification is deliberately conservative: a worktree is only ever called
``safe`` when its HEAD commit is reachable from some remote-tracking branch AND
its working tree is clean AND nothing suggests a session is using it. Anything
we cannot prove is recoverable gets held back for a human to look at.
