"""Remove git worktrees from a plan produced by ``scan_worktrees.py``.

Every worktree is re-verified immediately before it is removed, against fresh
git state and a fresh list of live sessions. This matters because scanning and
deleting are separate acts with a gap between them, and in that gap a session can
start, a file can be edited, or a branch can be reset. A plan is evidence about
the past; only a check taken at the moment of deletion says anything about now.

Dry-run by default. Pass --execute to actually remove.
